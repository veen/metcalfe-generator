# Baseline QA Notes

- Verified page loads via DevTools MCP at http://127.0.0.1:8000/interactive-network.html
- No console errors observed; network requests succeeded (see `QA 2025-10-23`).
- Manual interactions (pattern dropdown open/select, node slider, play/pause toggle) performed via DevTools; behaviour matched expectations.
- Unable to capture automated macro artifacts; record reflects manual validation.
