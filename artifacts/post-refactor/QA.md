# Final QA (Phase 4)

- Served via existing local http.server instance; loaded `interactive-network.html` as ES modules without bundling issues.
- Manual smoke: dropdown interactions, sliders, palette edits, play/pause, and auto-stop all behave as pre-refactor.
- Performance trace (DevTools MCP) still shows clean console and fast LCP (~334â€¯ms); no new warnings observed.
