# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository currently exposes two executables in the root: `network-animation-generator.js` drives frame synthesis and video muxing, while `run-animation.sh` wraps the Node entry point with dependency checks. Temporary frame directories are created via the `tmp` package and cleaned automatically; the rendered MP4 defaults to the repository root. When adding helper modules, co-locate reusable logic under a future `lib/` directory and keep CLI surfaces in small top-level files.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install runtime dependencies once per machine with `npm install canvas tmp fluent-ffmpeg`. Generate an animation directly via `node network-animation-generator.js '#FF8800' 1.5 14 200 out.mp4 30 12 '#FFFFFF' circular`. Use `./run-animation.sh --color '#0066CC' --pattern alternating` for the guided workflow; the script verifies Node availability, bootstraps packages, and passes CLI flags through. Confirm `ffmpeg -version` succeeds before running either command.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Maintain CommonJS modules (`require`/`module.exports`) and target Node 18+. Use two-space indentation, trailing commas only where required, and single quotes for strings. Favor descriptive camelCase for variables and functions, uppercase snake case for configuration arrays, and inline comments only when explaining coordinate math or frame timing.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no dedicated automated test suite yet. Before submitting changes, run the generator with representative arguments and review the resulting MP4 for frame continuity, color accuracy, and cleanup of the temporary directory. If you add testing, prefer lightweight smoke checks via `node` scripts or a headless canvas harness; name new test files `*.spec.js`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow an imperative, present-tense subject line under 72 characters, optionally prefixed with a simple scope (e.g., `anim: refine node ordering`). Include context in the body about visual or performance impacts and note any new flags. Pull requests should describe parameter defaults, reference relevant issues, and attach a short demo (GIF or MP4) generated by the updated scripts so reviewers can verify outcomes quickly.

## Environment & Dependencies
This project depends on native canvas bindings; on macOS install XQuartz and pkg-config first, and on Linux ensure `libcairo` toolchain packages are present. Keep `ffmpeg` updated to avoid codec mismatches, and document any additional system packages in your pull request.
