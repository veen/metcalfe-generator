# Metcalfe's Law Visualization Generator

![The Metcalfe Generator UI](metcalfe-visualizer-app.png)
This is a simple project built with Claude Code to explore and generate visualizations of Metcalfe's Law: an understanding that the value of a network grows with the square of its connections. It can be hard to grasp how quickly the connections in a network grow. This project turns that abstract growth into something you can see and feel instead of just calculating node counts.

## Install your own

Set up a local copy if you want to customize, experiment offline, or share a remix.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/veen/metcalfe-generator.git`
2. Serve the project statically from the repo root (for example `python3 -m http.server 8000`).
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in any modern browser (Chromium, Firefox, or Safari).

For development work, use Node 18+ to run local tooling and keep everything self-containedâ€”modules in `lib/` and styles in `styles/` are loaded directly in the browser without a bundler.
